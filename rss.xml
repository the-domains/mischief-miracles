The aching disrepair of its cities, the untamed foliage of its countryside, the orphaned coastlines - a half-century of isolation has wrapped the country in decay. Yet few places in the world brim with as much life as Cuba, a contrast drawn sharper amid its faded grandeur.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/196de034f71ac2612a2898c9ace08482d0e1afa6.jpg"></article>]]></description>
